# BL2-HC-MGMT
A little program for Borderlands 2 'Hardcore Mode'. Hardcore is a mode in which, on death, you throw weapons you currently have equipped away. This is adds additional challenges from punishing your deaths. The program itself allows you to: 1) Select number of equipment slots to "play with". 2) Cycle through 3 separate modes (Scaling [Scaling has 3 additional settings which correspond with difficulty], Random, and Pandemonium), 3) Displays which item(s) to throw away, and which to keep. 4) Can repeat with out going through the options again... Hardware utilized is an Arduino (Nano), 1.3" OLED display (w/ built in driver utilizing u8g library), and 2 buttons (w/ pull down resistors).
